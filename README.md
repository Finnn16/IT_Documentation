# IT_Documentation
100% Full Vibe Coding with GitHub Co-Pilot

# DISCLAIMER
This project, 100% Vibe Coding (Project: IT Documentation), was created purely for learning purposes. I built it during my free time to better understand how a Next.js project is structured and developed. My goal is to explore and learn the logic behind each part of the code and how everything connects. This is a personal study project, not intended for commercial use or distribution.
